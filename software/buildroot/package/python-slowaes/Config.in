      Implementations of AES in pure scripting languages (currently !Javascript,
      Python, Ruby, and PHP, but, in addition to further contributions in those
      languages, submissions in other scripting languages are also entirely
      welcome!).

      Such implementations will be slow (hence the project name) but still
      useful when faster ones are not available (for example, for JavaScript
      clients in browsers, and Python servers on Google App Engine).
